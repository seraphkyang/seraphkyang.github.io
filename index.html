        <strong>Summary |</strong>
        Hi! Welcome to my website! I am a sophomore at Valley Christian High School with a passion for computer science. As an aspiring engineer, I hope to learn more about all aspects of programming. In my free time, you will probably find me drawing, sleeping, 3D modeling, or playing squash!
        <br><br>
        <strong>Art Portfolio |</strong>
        This is a collection of my artwork over the years! I been learning how to sketch with charcoal for over five years at Ichen Art Academy, making it my focus medium when drawing. <strong><a href="art.html">View my art >>></a></strong>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Resume |</strong>
        An up-to-date record of my experiences, extracirriculars, academics, and more! It's a short, one-page resume about what I've done in my life! <strong><a href="resume.html">View my resume >>></a></strong>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Blog |</strong>
        This is a separate project I also work on in my spare time. Here, I post coding projects, ideas, and many other fun things I create! <strong><a href="#">View my blog >>></a></strong>

            <strong>3D Modeling</strong>
            <br>
            I learned 3D modeling during a semester long club at Valley Christian High School. There, I 3D modeled and printed standoffs and placers for robot parts. In my free time, I continue to CAD using Inventor or AutoCAD. Nothing I've modeled so far is very professional, so they aren't publicly available. If you want to take a look, however, I'd love to share them to you! Just contact me using the header button above!

            <strong>Programming</strong>
            <br>
            I have experience in the following languages:
            <br>
            - C++ | 4 yrs.
            <br>
            - Java | 1 yrs.
            <br>
            - Python | 5 yrs.
            <br>
            - HTML | 6 yrs.
            <br><br>
            I love programming! It's easily my favorite pastime, due to the variety of new things I can learn  and create with code. I mainly code in C++ and use it during coding competitions. I've played around with Python and learned it by myself using freeCodeCamp. I don't program too much with Python, however, I'll still try to use it when creating my own projects.  Next, I learned Java during my freshman year of high school in an AP Computer Science A course. Finally, I enjoy designing websites and playing around with HTML. My love for HTML began at an iD Tech camp in 2014, and I continue to expand upon what I've learned, designing and improving my websites every day!

          <strong>Drawing</strong>
          <br>
          I have experience in the following medium:
          <br>
          - Sketching | 7 yrs.
          <br>
          - Oil Painting | 1 yrs.
          <br><br>
          I started drawing when I was six at a local art studio. In 2015, two years after moving from Milpitas to Fremont, I started to draw at Ichen Art Academy, where I began to sketch on a more regular basis. I picked up oil painting during an Ichen Art Academy summer camp in 2021. I still oil paint, but focus more on sketching.
